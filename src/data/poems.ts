    content: `Everyday is sibling's day,
For they have to be celebrated,
No matter what day or time it is,
They should be our number one,
I will celebrate you.

Bigger parts of life's memories,
Are made by their existence,
With them we get to learn,
Build and protect each other,
I will celebrate you.

In my heart you'll always be,
My soul yours will never leave,
Will cherish our moments,
whether good or bad,
I will celebrate you.

I know someday will come,
And far from each other we'll live,
I pray our unity remains,
And our parents together we help,
I will celebrate you.`

I beg you endure it all times,
Be free to speak your mind,
I promise a solution to find,
Take me, make me yours.`

Blow out the candles one by one,
Make a wish for fun to never be done,

Decisions that turn to be fake,
They haunt down our lives,
Like bees chased from their hives,
Be careful the choice you make.

Never let them know your fears,
For they will turn them your tears,
Act bold and strong at all cost,
And the battle never be lost,
Be careful the choice you make.

At times we think we care,
But instead we shouldn't be there,
Stuck between should I or shouldn't I,
But still try to give our best,
May God protect us till rest,
Be careful the choice you make.`

    content: `Inside my heart is a scar,
A scar that scares,
Getting bigger day by day,
Wondering if it will fade someday,
Broken soul I am.

Around friends I hide my tears,
In order to escape my fears,
Fears of being judged,
Rather than being urged,
Broken soul I am.

People we thought would stay,
Left and went away,
Lonely souls we're left to be,
With no one in times of need,
Broken soul I am.

Hoping to recollect one day,
A happy soul to be again,
With people who won't leave,
Even if the situation is tough,
Broken soul I am.`
